### Purpose

I created this repository to share with the community my proposed solutions for the problems published on Hacker Rank. Please feel free to comment in case you have a suggestion or improvement on my solutions. I truly believe on getting better results if we build upon other work.


### Specifications
As I'm an iOS dev, the code is written in Swift because this is the language I feel more comofortable with. For some other problems, I wrote the solution in Java because Swift wasn't available.
